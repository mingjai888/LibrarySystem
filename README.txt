Better if you use eclipse (That's how we created this program).
Launch from Main.java (obviously).
Everytime you update the drawing picture, refresh eclipse (for some reason she doesn't like when we draw something).
If you compile it and what is created from the video does not exist, replace the .ser files that have been created in eclipse,
with the ones in CSGroup41/source/ and it will do the trick.
To search for a resource, make sure as soon as you open the window to press search (empty field) to setup the files.
